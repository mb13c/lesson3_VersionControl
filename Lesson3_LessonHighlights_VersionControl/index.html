            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The first key concept I have chosen to focus on is version control. Version control is a type of system or program that tracks changes made to a file or set of files so the user can go back and look at earlier versions at a later date. For example, say you and a group of people are working on a joint project. If your group utilizes a version control program, you can track the changes each member makes to the project in an organized way. It can allow you to revert the whole project back to a previous version if you need to and see which member made the changes. This also means easy file recovery if the project gets lost or damaged somehow.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The second key concept I wanted to focus on was creating a repository using the version control program Git. When you are starting to track a project, go to that project’s directory and type the command ‘$ git init’ which creates a subdirectory. This contains the required repository files and creates the repository frame. This new subdirectory is named .git. This hasn’t started tracking the changed you make to your files yet. To do so, you need to do an initial commit. You can do this with the following commands: ‘$ git add .’ ‘$ git commit -m ‘insert commit command’. After entering these commands into the directory, you have created a Git repository, began tracking your files, and done an initial commit.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Recording Changes</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The third key concept I have chosen to focus on is recording changes to the repository once you have created your Git repository. Your tracked files are files that that were in the last snapshot and untracked files are files that you are currently working on. Once you being editing your files, Git sees them as modified files because you have altered them since your last commit command. Once you stage the modified files and then commit the saved changes, the whole cycle begins again and that is how Git tracks your files. You can check the status of your files with the git status command. When you run this command, the result will look something like: ‘$ git status’ ‘on branch master’ ‘nothing to commit, working directory clean’. In other words, you have no modified or tracked files.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Tracking New Files</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The fourth key concept I have decided to focus on is tracking new files in the version control system Git. To begin tracking a new file, you simply use the command ‘git add’. Let’s say you want to begin tracking a file named Lesson3, you would run the command ‘$ git add Lesson3’. Once you run that command, you will see that your file is being tracked and is staged to be committed. If you decide to commit the file at this point, the version that will be saved will be the version of the file that existed when you ran the ‘git add’ command.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Stages</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The fifth and final key concept I would like to focus on is the three states that your files can be in within the Git program. The three states that your files can be in are committed, modified, and staged. If your file is committed, this means that the data is saved and stored in your database. Modified means that you or someone else has changed the file in some way but it has not yet been committed to the database. If your file is staged, this means that you have marked a file that you have changed and it is ready to be committed in its current version.</p>
